;; Description:

;;	This package provides functions to define and call internal
;;	drag and drop actions in the emacs. One could start such an 
;;	action by clicking with the mouse in the source buffer and 
;;	then in the destination buffer. The action could depend on
;;	the points where you've clicked with the mouse, on the state
;;	of the region, the point, the mark and any other properties
;;	of the source and the destination buffers. The actions are
;;	defined by the variable `idd-actions', which is a buffer local
;;	variable. The following is an example for the hm--html-mode:
;;	(defvar hm--html-idd-actions
;;	  '((nil (((idd-if-major-mode-p . dired-mode)
;;		   (idd-if-dired-file-on-line-p 
;;				. ".*\\.\\(gif\\)\\|\\(jpq\\)"))
;;		  hm--html-idd-add-include-image-from-dired-line)
;;		 (((idd-if-major-mode-p . dired-mode)
;;		   (idd-if-dired-no-file-on-line-p . nil))
;;		  hm--html-idd-add-file-link-to-file-on-dired-line)
;;		 (((idd-if-major-mode-p . dired-mode)
;;		   (idd-if-dired-no-file-on-line-p . t))
;;		  hm--html-idd-add-file-link-to-directory-of-buffer)
;;		 (((idd-if-major-mode-p . w3-mode)
;;		   (idd-if-url-at-point-p . t))
;;		  hm--html-idd-add-html-link-from-w3-buffer-point)
;;		 (((idd-if-major-mode-p . w3-mode))
;;		  hm--html-idd-add-html-link-to-w3-buffer)
;;		 (((idd-if-local-file-p . t))
;;		  hm--html-idd-add-file-link-to-buffer)))
;;	Look at the variable `idd-actions' for further descriptions.


;; Installation: 

;;	Put this file in one of your load path directories.

;;	Put the following in your .emacs:
;;	(autoload 'idd-mouse-drag-and-drop "internal-drag-and-drop"
;;	   "Performs a drag and drop action.
;;         At first you must click on the source and 
;;         after that on the destination."
;;	   t)

;;	Define actions in the variable `idd-actions'.

;;	The variable `idd-global-mouse-keys' defines the mouse keys,
;;	which are bound to the drag and drop command.

;;	The variable `idd-global-help-mouse-keys' defines the mouse keys,
;;	which are bound to the drag and drop help command.

;;	The variable `idd-drag-and-drop-mouse-binding-type' determines
;;	if you've to hold a mouse button down during moving the mouse
;;	from the source to the destination or not.

;;	Emacs 19 users should read carefully the whole comments of
;;	`idd-drag-and-drop-mouse-binding-type', `idd-global-mouse-keys'
;;	and `idd-global-help-mouse-keys', if they would like to change
;;	any of these variables or the mouse bindings!

The value maybe `click' or `press-button-during-move'.
A value of `click' means, that you've to click over the source, leave
the button and click it again over the destination.
A value of `press-button-during-move' means, that you've to press
the button down over the source and hold it until the mouse pointer
is over the destination.

The disadvantage of the `press-button-during-move' type compared with 
the `click' type is, that you can't select a destination region and 
therefore a drag and drop action depending on a selected region can't
be started with that type of mouse binding.

Note: In the Emacs 19 you'll have to change also the keybindings of
the drag and drop commands, if you change this variable. Look at the
variables `idd-global-mouse-keys' and `idd-global-help-mouse-keys' for
this."

  "*The list with actions, depending on the source and the destination.
The list looks like:
  '((<destination-specification-1> (<source-specification-1> <action-1-1>)

                                    :
     )
    :
    )
The <source-specification> looks like the following:
  '([(<specification-type> <value>)])
with <specification-type> :== idd-if-minor-mode-p | idd-if-buffer-name-p
			      | idd-if-region-active-p | idd-if-url-at-point-p
                              | idd-if-major-mode-p | idd-if-variable-non-nil-p
                              | idd-if-dired-file-on-line-p
                              | idd-if-dired-no-file-on-line-p
                              | idd-if-local-file-p | idd-if-buffer-name-p
                              | idd-if-modifiers-p | ...

The <specification-type> - functions must have two arguments, the first one
is the source or destination and the second is the <value>. It must return
nil, if the test wasn't successfull and a number (in general 1), which 
specifies the weight of the test function. The weights of all single tests
are added to a summary weight and assigned to the action. The action
with the highest weight is called from the action handler. Look at
the definition of `idd-if-major-mode-p', `idd-if-minor-mode-p' and so on for
examples. Look at the function `idd-get-source-or-destination-alist', if
you wan't to know the structure of the 'source-or-destination' argument
of these functions.

The <destination-specification> looks like <source-specification>,
but in general it could be set to nil in mode specific idd-action
lists.

If <destination-specification-1> or <source-specification-1> is set to
nil, then every source or source matches. `idd-actions' is a
buffer local variable, which should be at least mode depended. So if
the <destination-specification-1> is set to nil it says, that the destination
buffer must only have a specific mode. But however, it's also possible
to define a general `idd-actions' list, where the destination mode is
specified by `idd-if-major-mode-p'.

<action> ist a function, which has two arguments, the first specifies the
source and the second the destination. Look at the function definition
of `idd-action-copy-region' and `idd-action-copy-replace-region'. They are 
examples for such actions."
