;;;			   (muenkel@tnt.uni-hannover.de)
;;; Changed: 19.07.1993 by Heiko Muenkel
;;; Changed: 28.12.1993 by Heiko Muenkel
;;;	Changed (signal-process id 30)
;;;	to	(signal-process id html-sigusr1-signal-value)
;;;	Addapted the file for the new Mosaic-2.1
;;;	Thanks to Neal Becker, who has reported this problem.
;;;	The file now requires the package hm--html-menus.
;;;	But you can also delete the line (require 'hm--html) and
;;;	add a line like (setq html-sigusr1-signal-value 30)
;;; Changed: 10.01.1994 by Heiko Muenkel
;;;	Fixed a bug.
;;; Changed: 16.12.1994 by Heiko Münkel
;;;     Addapted the file for Mosaic-2.4.
;;; Changed: 03.02.1995 by Heiko Münkel
;;;	The "view-buffer" is now different from the original buffer.
;;;	So the name of the original buffer isn't change anymore. 
;;; Changed: 02.04.1995 by Heiko Münkel
;;;	Integrated the changes from the XEmacs distribution.
;;; Changed: 20.07.1995 by Heiko Münkel
;;;	Fixed a bug in html-view-goto-url.
;;; Changed: 05.11.1998 by Heiko Münkel

;;; Commentary: 
;;; To use, just set the value of html-view-mosaic-command to whatever you
;;; use to run NCSA Mosaic. You may have to set html-view-tmp-file.
;;; Type M-x html-view-start-mosaic <ret>. 
;;; Afterwards, view files/buffers with html-view-view-file/
;;; html-view-view-buffer. There's also a command, of dubious utility,
;;; for jumping to particular documents: html-view-goto-url
;;;
;;; If you have any questions or comments mail to tapia@hydra.unm.edu.
